                Welcome to my website.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let me use this opportunity to quickly introduce myself to you.
                <br>
                <br>

                Hi, I'm Diana Dai, a freelance web developer.
                <br>
                <br>

                In my spare time, I love traveling the world. And currently, I’m living in the beautiful city Melbourne.
                <br>
                <br>

                My working time is dedicated to <span class="highlight">creating a professional “online image”
                </span>for
                small
                business
                owners. Doing
                so, I use a very unique approach…
                <br>
                <br>

                Here’s the story behind it:
                <br>
                <br>

                Using usual website builders at first, I was never truly satisfied with the performance of websites
                built by WordPress & co.
                <br>
                <br>

                On top of that, it just wasn’t a good experience to work with them - It just wasn’t fun for me.
                <br>
                <br>

                So about two years ago I decided to jump off from them… And taught meyself to <span class="highlight">
                    code every line “from
                    scratch”</span>.
                <br>
                <br>

                And let me tell you this - I couldn’t be more proud about the results my clients get today.
                <br>
                <br>

                Want to see why?
                <br>
                <br>

                <ul class="pl-6">
                    <li>
                        "Hand-coded" websites do not just reach the official benchmark of 2 seconds loading speed… they
                        absolutely crush it. (<span class="highlight">0.5 seconds</span> is NO challenge!). Makes both
                        your customer as well as
                        Google's
                        algorithm happy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a "handwritten” code powers your website, maintenance is
                        (almost) non-existent.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        Small business owners don’t need to fear cyber attacks, right?
                        Sorry, but the truth needs to be told: An article by Microsoft reveals - 43% of all
                        cyber-attacks target
                        small businesses!
                        The solution? Combining my websites with a "CDN" - and you <span class="highlight">never need to
                            worry about any hacker</span>.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                    </li>
                    <li> Usage of the secret <span class="highlight">"Mobile-First Indexing" trick</span>, that’ll force
                        the algorithm to push your
                        Google
                        ranking up. (Hint: Website builders deny you to do this.)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>And much, much more…</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </ul>
